    "Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment\n",
    "are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered\n",
    "  architectures\n",
    "- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**\n",
    "- implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks\n",
    "- implement **batch normalization** for training deep networks\n",
    "- implement **dropout** to regularize networks\n",
    "- effectively **cross-validate** and find the best hyperparameters for Neural\n",
    "  Network architecture\n",
    "- understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks**\n",
    "- gain an understanding of how a modern deep learning library (PyTorch) works\n",
    "  and gain practical experience using it to train models.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "Make sure your machine is set up with the assignment dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**[Option 1] Use Anaconda:**\n",
    "The preferred approach for installing all the assignment dependencies is to use\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which is a Python distribution\n",
    "that includes many of the most popular Python packages for science, math,\n",
    "engineering and data analysis. Once you install it you can skip all mentions of\n",
    "requirements and you are ready to go directly to working on the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Option 2] Manual install, virtual environment:**\n",
    "If you do not want to use Anaconda and want to go with a more manual and risky\n",
    "installation route you will likely want to create a\n",
    "[virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)\n",
    "for the project. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you\n",
    "to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed globally on your\n",
    "machine. To set up a virtual environment, run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd assignment1\n",
    "sudo pip install virtualenv      # This may already be installed\n",
    "virtualenv .env                  # Create a virtual environment\n",
    "source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies\n",
    "# Work on the assignment for a while ...\n",
    "deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download data:**\n",
    "Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",
    "Run the following from the `assignment1` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd deeplearning/datasets\n",
    "./get_datasets.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on Mac, this script may not work if you do not have the wget command \n",
    "installed, but you can use curl instead with the alternative script.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd deeplearning/datasets\n",
    "./get_datasets_curl.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compile the Cython extension:** Convolutional Neural Networks require a very\n",
    "efficient implementation. We have implemented of the functionality using\n",
    "[Cython](http://cython.org/); you will need to compile the Cython extension\n",
    "before you can run the code. From the `deeplearning` directory, run the following\n",
    "command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start IPython:**\n",
    "After you have the CIFAR-10 data, you should start the IPython notebook server\n",
    "from the `assignment1` directory. If you are unfamiliar with IPython, you should \n",
    "read our [IPython tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** If you are working in a virtual environment on OSX, you may encounter\n",
    "errors with matplotlib due to the\n",
    "[issues described here](http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html).\n",
    "You can work around this issue by starting the IPython server using the\n",
    "`start_ipython_osx.sh` script from the `assignment1` directory; the script\n",
    "assumes that your virtual environment is named `.env`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting your work:\n",
    "Once you are done working run the `collectSubmission.sh` script;\n",
    "this will produce a file called `assignment1.zip`.\n",
    "Upload this file to Gradescope.\n",
    "Note that Gradescope will run an autograder on the files you submit. For some \n",
    "test cases, there is a nonzero (but should be very low) probability that correct \n",
    "implementations may fail due to randomness. If you think your implementation is \n",
    "correct, then you can simply resubmit to rerun the autograder to check whether\n",
    "it really is just a particularly unlucky seed.. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (35 points)\n",
    "The IPython notebook `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` will introduce you to our\n",
    "modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected\n",
    "networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several\n",
    "popular update rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Batch Normalization (25 points)\n",
    "In the IPython notebook `BatchNormalization.ipynb` you will implement batch\n",
    "normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Dropout (10 points)\n",
    "The IPython notebook `Dropout.ipynb` will help you implement Dropout and explore\n",
    "its effects on model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: ConvNet (20 points)\n",
    "In the IPython Notebook `ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb` you will implement several\n",

    "a small convolutional network.\n",

    "### Q5: Train a model on CIFAR10 using Pytorch! (10 points)\n",
    "Now that you've implemented and gained an understanding for many key components \n",
    "of a basic deep learning library, it is time to move on to a modern deep learning\n",
    "library: Pytorch. Here, we will walk you through the key concepts of PyTorch, and\n",
    "you will use it to experiment and train a model on CIFAR10. We highly recommend \n",
    "you use Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) for this notebook, as it\n",
    "comes with Pytorch installed and provides access to GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Colab for this notebook, make sure to manually download the completed \n",
    "notebook and place it in the assignment directory before submitting. Also remember \n",
    "to download required output file and place it into submission_logs/ directory.\n",
