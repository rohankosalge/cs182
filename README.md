# CS W182/282A Self-Study

In this course, I had the opportunity to:
- read several papers throughout the history of deep learning (from AlexNet to the Transformer, to the GAN, MAML, and more)
- critically understand the lecture material and improve my mathematical maturity.
- apply my understanding through the homework assignments.<br>

Note: Homework 4 is not listed here. I was unable to install the necessary requirements for the RL-based assignment, as several modules/frameworks, including Python/Mac OS, have evolved in the last 4 years. I plan to resolve this issue in the near future.
